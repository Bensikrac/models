## Code Standards
We use *pylint* as our Python code linter of choice.
Please ensure that all problems detected by *pylint* are resolved before opening a pull request.
We have configured an automated *pylint* github action upon pull request that will scan code for issues.

The easiest way to run *pylint* is to download an extension for your IDE of choice.
For example, VSCode provides Python and Pylint extensions that will automatically show you issues detected by Pylint in the 'problems' section of the integrated terminal.

You can also install *pylint* manually with your package manager of choice and run from the command line using the instructions here: https://docs.pylint.org/run.html
